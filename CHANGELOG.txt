Mad Chatter

Version 0.2.5
 - Adjusted daemonization process

Version 0.2.4
 - Minor update (forgot I changed some filename)

Version 0.2.3
 - Finally got extensions working by refactoring a bunch of stuff

Version 0.2.2
 - Added daemonization so you can start, stop, restart Mad Chatter

Version 0.2.1
 - Realized the simple extensions aren't actually working. This is why we need tests. :(
 - Also, fixed some styles that weren't being applied.

Version 0.2.0
 - Added a '/clear' command to client-side javascript to be able to clear all chat messages
 - Fixed HTML injection vulnerability by adding markdown parsing and escaping all incoming html
 - Created a MacRuby application as a GUI wrapper (still need to add a link to the github repo)
 - Disabled extensions directory for now since example is no longer working.
 - Finally added /youtube example mentioned in the readme

Version 0.1.1-3
 - Added a 'preview' command to CLI to run both a web server and web socket server
 - Fixed bug where user leaving chatroom didn't notify other users

Version 0.1.0
 - Refactored extension architecture. Much nicer syntax now.
 - Moved some of the main configuration to a config.yml file (which is generated when you use the 'new' command)
 - Created skeleton classes for alternative web socket server implementations and moved the default implementation into its own class
 - Switched to using Bundler (instead of Jeweler) for gem deployments, thanks to this article: http://mlomnicki.com/ruby/rubygems/2011/01/22/jeweler-vs-bundler.html

Versions < 0.1.0
 - Some of the features were implemented, but there were many holes that needed to be filled
