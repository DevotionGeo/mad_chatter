Mad Chatter

Version 0.1.0
 - Refactored extension architecture. Much nicer syntax now.
 - Moved some of the main configuration to a config.yml file (which is generated when you use the 'new' command)
 - Created skeleton classes for alternative web socket server implementations and moved the default implementation into its own class

Versions < 0.1.0
 - Some of the features were implemented, but there were many holes that needed to be filled
