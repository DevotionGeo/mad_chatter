# Mad Chatter

Mad Chatter is a fun, easy to customize chat server. It's written in Ruby and utilizes HTML 5 Web Sockets for fast communication. It also has support for Markdown.

## Getting Started

Since Mad Chatter is written in Ruby, you'll need to install Ruby in order to continue. We have a wiki page to help you with that:

[How to install Ruby and RubyGems](https://github.com/andrewhavens/mad_chatter/wiki/How-to-install-Ruby-and-RubyGems)

Once you have RubyGems installed, you can install the Mad Chatter gem:

    gem install mad_chatter

Then generate the directory where your chat application will live:

    mad_chatter new mychatroom

This command will generate the following structure:

    mychatroom/
        config.rb       # for general configuration
        extensions.rb   # for writing your own extensions
        web/            # all of the html, css, and javascript live here

To start your chat server, navigate to the directory that was just created and run...

    mad_chatter preview

This will start up the Mad Chatter chat server as well as a simple web server for you to preview/demo your new chat room. Now you can check it out by opening http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see something like this:

When you're ready to have other people use your chat server (friends, family, co-workers, etc) you'll want to host the server and web directory some place that they can access (on a web server, for example, if it will be used outside your local network). You'll also want to start the chat server and leave it running for a long time in the background. This is known as a "daemon". Here are a few useful commands for that:

    mad_chatter start
		mad_chatter stop
		mad_chatter restart

## Chat Actions

Mad Chatter can do some special things depending on the chat messages you send. Every chat message is parsed to see if it is a normal chat message, or if its a special action. These actions are much like IRC commands. For example, if I wanted to change my screen name from Andrew to Andy I could chat this message:

    /nick andy

Mad Chatter will interpret this message as an action and change the user name to andy.

If I wanted to embed a YouTube video for all the members of the chatroom to enjoy, I could type:

    /youtube http://youtu.be/n1NVfDlU6yQ

Or if I wanted to shake everyone's chat window:

    /earthquake

You can even create your own actions!


## Customizing

The goal of Mad Chatter is to make it easy to create, host, and customize your own chat server. Let's take a look at the different ways you can customize your new chat server.

If you want to customize the html/css of your chatroom, you'll find it in the `web` directory.

In the `config.yml` file you can see a few things you can customize.

The `extensions.rb` file is for you to create your own chat extensions. You will find a few examples in that file.


## Mac, Windows, and Linux Wrappers

Once you've got your chat server running and being used by other people, you might be interested in using/distributing an installable application so your users have the convenience of clicking on an icon, receiving growl notifications, etc. Here's a list of the currently available "wrapper" applications:
