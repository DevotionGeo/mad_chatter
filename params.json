{"name":"Mad chatter","body":"# Mad Chatter\r\n\r\nMad Chatter is a fun, easy to customize chat server. It's written in Ruby and utilizes HTML 5 Web Sockets for fast communication.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Mad Chatter is to basically become an open-source version of [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/), [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com), or [FlowDock](https://www.flowdock.com)...or at least use those as inspiration.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nSince Mad Chatter is written in Ruby, you'll need to install Ruby in order to continue. We have a wiki page to help you with that:\r\n\r\n[How to install Ruby and RubyGems](https://github.com/andrewhavens/mad_chatter/wiki/How-to-install-Ruby-and-RubyGems)\r\n\r\nOnce you have RubyGems installed, you can install the Mad Chatter gem:\r\n\r\n    gem install mad_chatter\r\n\r\nThen generate the directory where your chat application will live:\r\n\r\n    mad_chatter new mychatroom\r\n\r\nThis command will generate the following structure:\r\n\r\n    mychatroom/\r\n        config.yml      # for general configuration\r\n        extensions/     # for writing your own extensions\r\n        web/            # all of the html, css, and javascript live here\r\n\r\nTo start your chat server, navigate to the directory that was just created and run...\r\n\r\n    mad_chatter preview\r\n\r\nThis will start up the Mad Chatter chat server as well as a simple web server for you to preview/demo your new chat room. Now you can check it out by opening http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see something like this:\r\n\r\n![Mad Chatter screenshot](https://raw.github.com/andrewhavens/mad_chatter/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to have other people start using your new chat server (friends, family, co-workers, etc) you'll need to set up a web server so other people can access it. Set up your web server to serve the `web` directory that we created above. Now you're ready to start Mad Chatter and leave it running in the background. Here are a few useful commands for that:\r\n\r\n    mad_chatter start\r\n    mad_chatter stop\r\n    mad_chatter restart\r\n\r\n## Chat Actions\r\n\r\nMad Chatter can do some special things depending on the chat messages you send. Every chat message is parsed to see if it is a normal chat message, or if it's a special action. These actions are much like IRC commands. For example, if I wanted to change my name from Andrew to Andy I could chat this message:\r\n\r\n    /nick andy\r\n\r\nMad Chatter will interpret this message as an action and change the user name to andy.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to embed a YouTube video for all the members of the chatroom to enjoy, I could type:\r\n\r\n    /youtube http://youtu.be/n1NVfDlU6yQ\r\n\r\nOr if I wanted to shake everyone's chat window:\r\n\r\n    /earthquake\r\n\r\nYou can even create your own actions!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Customizing\r\n\r\nThe goal of Mad Chatter is to make it easy to create, host, and customize your own chat server. Let's take a look at the different ways you can customize your new chat server.\r\n\r\nAll of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript is available for you to customize in the `web` directory.\r\n\r\nIn the `config.yml` file you can see a few things you can customize.\r\n\r\nThe `extensions` directory contains all of your extensions. If you wanted to create a custom action, this is where you would put it. You will find a few examples in that directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Mac, Windows, and Linux Wrappers\r\n\r\nOnce you've got your chat server running and being used by other people, you might be interested in using and distributing an installable application so your users have the convenience of clicking on an icon, receiving growl notifications, etc. Here's a list of the currently available \"wrapper\" applications:\r\n\r\n * [Mad Chatter for Mac](https://github.com/andrewhavens/mad_chatter_for_mac)\r\n\r\n## Getting Help / Providing Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you need help or have feedback, feel free to submit bug reports and feature requests to our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/andrewhavens/mad_chatter/issues), or post to the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/mad-chatter).\r\n\r\nYou can also vote on upcoming features: https://madchatter.uservoice.com\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease fork and send pull requests!
